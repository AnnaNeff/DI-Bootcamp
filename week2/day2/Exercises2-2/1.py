# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4: Family and Person Classes
# Goal:

# Practice working with classes and object interactions by modeling a family and its members.



# Key Python Topics:

# Classes and objects
# Instance methods
# Object interaction
# Lists and loops
# Conditional statements (if/else)
# String formatting (f-strings)


# Instructions:

# Step 1: Create the Person Class

# Define a Person class with the following attributes:
# first_name
# age
# last_name (string, should be initialized as an empty string)
# Add a method called is_18():
# It should return True if the person is 18 or older, otherwise False.

class Person:
    def __init__(self, first_name, age, last_name = ""):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.age = age
        self.last_name = last_name

    def is_18(self):
        if self.age > 18:
            return True

# Step 2: Create the Family Class

# Define a Family class with:
# A last_name attribute
# A members list that will store Person objects (should be initialized as an empty list)

class Family(Person):
    def __init__(self, last_name, family_members = []):
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.family_members = family_members


# Add a method called born(first_name, age):
# It should create a new Person object with the given first name and age.
# It should assign the familyâ€™s last name to the person.
# It should add this new person to the members list.
    def born(self, first_name, age):
        family_member = Person(first_name, age, self.last_name)
        self.family_members.append(family_member)

# Add a method called check_majority(first_name):
# It should search the members list for a person with that first_name.
# If the person exists, call their is_18() method.
# If the person is over 18, print:
# "You are over 18, your parents Jane and John accept that you will go out with your friends"
# Otherwise, print:
# "Sorry, you are not allowed to go out with your friends."

    def check_majority(self, first_name):
        for member in self.family_members:
            if member.first_name == first_name:
                if member.is_18():
                    print(
                        f"You are over 18, your parents Jane and John accept that you will go out with your friends"
                    )
                else:
                    print("Sorry, you are not allowed to go out with your friends.")
                return
        print(f"No family member named {first_name} found.")
            


# Add a method called family_presentation():
# It should print the familyâ€™s last name.
# Then, it should print each family memberâ€™s first name and age.
    def family_presentation(self):
        print(f'{self.last_name} family:')
        for member in self.family_members:
            print(f'{member.first_name}, {member.age}')

# Expected Behavior:

# Once implemented, your program should allow you to:

# Create a family with a last name.
# Add members to the family using the born() method.
# Use check_majority() to see if someone is allowed to go out.
# Display family information with family_presentation().
# Donâ€™t forget to test your classes by creating an instance of Family, adding members, and calling each method to see the expected output.


my_family = Family("Kevlya")

my_family.born("Anna", 34)
my_family.born("Sofia", 27)
my_family.born("Liza", 26)
my_family.born("Daria", 58)
my_family.born("Sergey", 60)
my_family.born("Mark", 1)
my_family.born("Noa", 1)

my_family.check_majority("Mark")
my_family.family_presentation()
