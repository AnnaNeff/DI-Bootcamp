-- Get a list of all the languages, from the language table.

SELECT name FROM language

-- Get a list of all films joined with their languages ‚Äì select the following details : film title, description, and language name.

-- Create a new table called new_film with the following columns : id, name. Add some new films to the table.

-- Create a new table called customer_review, which will contain film reviews that customers will make.

-- Think about the DELETE constraint: if a film is deleted, its review should be automatically deleted.
-- It should have the following columns:
-- review_id ‚Äì a primary key, non null, auto-increment.
-- film_id ‚Äì references the new_film table. The film that is being reviewed.
-- language_id ‚Äì references the language table. What language the review is in.
-- title ‚Äì the title of the review.
-- score ‚Äì the rating of the review (1-10).
-- review_text ‚Äì the text of the review. No limit on the length.
-- last_update ‚Äì when the review was last updated.

review_id SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
film_id INTEGER,
language_id INTEGER,
title VARCHAR (100),

-- Which foreign keys (references) are defined for the customer table? How does this affect the way in which we INSERT into the customer table?

--The customer table has two foreign keys:
-- store_id and address_id.

-- We must use an existing store_id and an existing address_id (not null).
-- So usually we create/select the address first, then insert the customer with those ids.
-- If the ids don‚Äôt exist, the insert fails with a foreign-key error.

-- We created a new table called customer_review. Drop this table. Is this an easy step, or does it need extra checking?

DROP TABLE customer_review
