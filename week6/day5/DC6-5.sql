-- ðŸŒŸ Task 1: Calculate the Average Budget Growth Rate for Each Production Company
-- Calculate the average budget growth rate for each production company across all movies they have produced. Use window functions to determine the budget growth rate and then calculate the average growth rate.

  SELECT pc.company_name, m.movie_id, m.title, m.release_date, m.budget,

-- ðŸŒŸ Task 2: Determine the Most Consistently High-Rated Actor
-- Identify the actor who has appeared in the most movies that are rated above the average rating of all movies. Use window functions and CTEs to calculate the average rating and filter the actors based on this criterion.

WITH movie_with_global_avg AS (
  SELECT
    m.movie_id,

    AVG(m.vote_average) OVER () AS global_avg_rating

-- ðŸŒŸ Task 3: Calculate the Rolling Average Revenue for Each Genre
-- Calculate the rolling average revenue for movies within each genre, considering only the last three movies released in the genre. Use window functions with the ROWS frame specification to achieve this.

SELECT
  g.genre_name,
  m.title,
  m.release_date,
  m.revenue,
  AVG(m.revenue) OVER (
    PARTITION BY g.genre_name

JOIN genre g ON g.genre_id = mg.genre_id
ORDER BY g.genre_name, m.release_date, m.movie_id

-- ðŸŒŸ Task 4: Identify the Highest-Grossing Movie Series
-- Identify the movie series (based on shared keywords) with the highest total revenue. Use window functions and CTEs to group movies by their series and calculate the total revenue.

WITH kw_rev AS (
  SELECT
    k.keyword_id,
    k.keyword_name,
    m.movie_id,
    m.title,
    m.revenue,

    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_revenue_by_series DESC) AS rnk
